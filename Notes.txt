Prototype is responsible for this keyword,new,classes and prototypal inheritance.
Everything in javascript is an Object.
eg: array, string and functions are also derived from objects.
 
   function multipleBy5(num){
    return num*5
   }
   multipleBy5(5)
   multipleBy5.power=2   ===//here we are using . with the function
                              hence function is also an objects
